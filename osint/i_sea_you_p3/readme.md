I SEA You (Part 3)
Author: Incognito
Category: OSINT
Difficulty: Medium
Description: 
This is the third and final challenge of the "I SEA You Series"

Good Job Once Again! We are on to them!
We have intel that Agent Orca has replaced his old Samsung phone with a new Apple phone, and has left the Samsung Phone somewhere in Singapore!  
Use Orca's Instagram Account that you have obtained in Challenge 2 to locate the last seen location of Agent Orca's Phone.

You will need to find: 
1. The Name of the Building Agent Orca's Phone is at (lowercase, including numbers, and no spaces, if any)
2. The Postal Code of that Building (only numbers)

And submit it in the format STANDCON22{<the name of the building agent orca's phone is in>_<postal code>}

You will find both pieces of information together. 

For instance, a valid flag submission for the phone at building "Amazing Architecture 123 Pte Ltd" at Singapore 131039 would be STANDCON22{amazingarchitecture123pteltd_131039}

In this challenge, you are guranteed to have all the information required available for you to find. There should be no scripting required for brute forcing. No external third party tools except Instagram is required for the first part of the challenge. 

To prevent brute-forcing of the flag, you are limited to 15 attempts. Use them wisely.
This OSINT Challenge does not require contact with any third-party. Do not attempt to email, call or make contact with any individual. If you have queries, open a ticket.
