I SEA You (Part 2)
Author: Incognito
Category: OSINT
Difficulty: Easy
Description: 
This is the second challenge of the "I SEA You Series" (out of a total of three challenges)

Good Job Recruit! We investigated Agent Orca and found that he has unfortunately left Singapore! However, all hope is not lost! Although he has wiped out most of his Computer's Hard Drive, we have managed to recover a file that he stored online.
Investigate the file and report back!

Access the file here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10uAbsSbh9LVSDK4Qwa4QfiFGBBl1zKi5OdSCVoPJQ5I/edit#slide=id.p

You will need to find: 
1. The original title of the file (lowercase, no spaces, if any)
2. Date of File Creation (DDMMYYYY) (GMT+8, SGT)
3. Orca's Instagram Handle (including the @, lowercase)
4. The Secret Text on the second last Slide (copy it down as you see it - no spaces)

And submit it in the format STANDCON22{<original title of file>_<date of file creation in the format DDMMYYYY>_<agent orca's instagram handle>_<the secret text>}

For instance, a valid flag submission would be: 
STANDCON22{filenamewithnospaces_02022022_@thisisnotarealaccount_somemagicsecret}

To prevent brute-forcing of the flag, you are limited to 15 attempts. Use them wisely.
This OSINT Challenge does not require contact with any third-party. Do not attempt to email, call or make contact with any individual. If you have queries, open a ticket.

Hint 1 is intended to help participants find Orca's Instagram Handle
Hint 2 is intended to help participants obtain the Secret Text on the second last slide
