I SEA You (Part 1)
Author: Incognito
Category: Misc. / OSINT
Difficulty: Easy
Description: 
This challenge is partially an OSINT challenge. 
This is also the first challenge of the "I SEA You Series" (out of a total of three challenges)

After the golden crown was stolen, our team of operatives intercepted unusual sea-radio waves coming from our stronghold. 
We suspect that there is a double-agent that helped Atlantis steal the crown! 

Hint 1 will only be useful to you if you have not made any progress at all.
Hint 2 will only be useful to you if you have obtained the first part of the flag and are completely stuck/have not made any progress from there at all.  
Hint 3 will only be useful to you if you have made some but very minimal progress after obtaining the first part of the flag.

Your Mission: Intercept the message and make contact with the double-agent
