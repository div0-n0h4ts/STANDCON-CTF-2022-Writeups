*Creator - Edwin*

## Description
Sang Nila Utama received a fishy gift from the Russia Empire, however something isnt right.


## Solution
1. Manually unzip the file from different zip format to understand how the zipping works
*bzip2, gzip, zip* randomly > convert to base64
2. Write a script to unzip the file 
3. Final result will be in hex and you have to convert to string
